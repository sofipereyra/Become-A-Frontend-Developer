Git it’s open sourced developed by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel, in 2005.

It's a Distributed Version Control System (VCS) that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 

Benefits: 

- Change history of every file. 
- Branching and merging. 
- Traceability. 

Some important concepts: 

- Repository: documents at git’s that keep track the project history.
- Commit: it's each one of the changes registered at git’s repository.
- Branch: Represents an independent line of development. Pointers to commits.
- Stashing: shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else.
- Hooks: scripts that Git executes when certain events occur in the repository. 

Commond Commands:
- git init --> creates a new Git repository.
- git clone --> target an existing repository and create a clone.
- git status --> displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
- git add . --> adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
- git commit --> captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
- git rm  --> to remove individual files or a collection of files.
- git branch --> create, list, rename, and delete branches.
- git checkout --> command to visit a commit.
- git push origin branch_name --> used to upload local repository content to a remote repository.
- git pull origin branch_name --> used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
- git merge branch_name --> lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
